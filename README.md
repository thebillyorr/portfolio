# Personal Universe

My personal portfolio site. A modular playground with draggable cards, glassmorphic design, and some fun interactive effects.

## What's Here

- **Interactive hero section** - Name tracks your mouse with sparkle effects
- **Draggable playground** - Move and resize cards on a snapping grid
- **Resume timeline** - Career history with animated company logos
- **Design portfolio** - Collection of posters with lightbox viewer
- **Photo gallery** - Random selection from various adventures
- **Theme toggle** - Animated day/night switch
- **Glassmorphism** - Frosted glass effects throughout

## Tech Stack

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, just modern web features:
- CSS Grid & Flexbox for layouts
- backdrop-filter for glassmorphic effects  
- CSS custom properties for theming
- ES6 modules for code organization
- localStorage for persistence
